## Project Overview

A Fortune 500 technology company is embarking on a strategic growth initiative in the market for In-Memory Computing (IMC). The company believes that IMC has the potential to reduce data tranfer overhead for customers, especially for those performing real-time analytics applications where latency and power consumption are major concerns.

The company has asked for an external assessment of the IMC market, including analysis on the emerging IMC exosystem, competitive landscape, prospecive applications, technology requirements, and implications for existing asset areas. Additionally, it is interested in better understanding of how IMC assets are capabilities are perceived versus competitive alternatives. Market analysis and strategic recommendations will be based on in-depth voice-of-market interviews with key IMC subject matter experts, as well as current & former personnel at leading IMC competitor and customer organizations. The end goal of this effort is to develop a set of strategies and tactics to help the company capture new revenue and share in the IMC market.

This 2-month project overview details the research process to perform the research and advisory effort to aid in the development of the company's growth strategy in the market for in-memory computing:

##### Project Objectives

-   Map the IMC technology ecosystem and competitive landscape
-   Audit market perspectives on the value proposition of IMC versus competitive alternatives
-   Assess most promising initial applications and anticipated early adopters of IMC technology
-   Evaluate emerging feature and capability expectations for IMC solutions
-   Investigate technical or structural inhibitors to scaling IMC technology
-   Assess the company's competitive advantages in the IMC technology domain
-   Develop a set of strategies and tactics to drive new growth and share aligned to the IMC market

## Responsibilities

I was 1 of 3 researchers working on the project, including analysis and interviews with key opinion leaders (KOLs). Additionally, I took part in the competitive analysis of competitors as well as comparisons to technologies that address the same goals such as NVMEs. During the weekly updates and the final presentation, I was also responsible for presenting my section of the research directly to the client.

My primary responsibilies included reaching out to relevant external stakeholders, conducting interviews, analysis of quotes and secondary research, and the creation of presentation slides for my research.

## User Research

As shown in the engagement timeline, the first step in the project was the creation of 6 project scope questions that covered questions the company sought to answer in their assessment of the IMC technology ecosystem. Afterwards, an interview guide was created in order to conduct the semi-structured interviews with KOLs. Participants ranged from Infastructure Engineers, Datacenter Engineers, Software Engineers, and more throughout the US.

## Analysis

I started by researching similar technologies as well as industry thoughts on IMC through available secondary sources. This included public forums, academic journals, and market resports. These sources helped me gauge the overall market size, growth potential, and competitive landscape. Additionally, this also informed me about IMC's devlopmental status. This aided me in the creation of the interview guide used for the interviewed KOLs mentioned preivously. 

The interview process was structured to reveal thoughts within working engineers in the industry. To assess gaps in the market, I designed questions to probe specific areas like their thoughts on the scalability of IMC, the effect of similar technologies such as NVMEs and near-memory computing, potential use cases, and the perceived increased effectiveness of IMC technology. Additionally, I analyzed competitor activity through secondary research on major players in the industry. I researched what innovations were being introduced by multinational corporations. This helped to frame the competitive landscape and pinpoint where opportunities for innovation existed.

## Reflections and Takeaways

I got a chance to sharpen both my research and client presentation skills as well as perform work in the technology space. The research I conducted was in an unfamiliar technology sector and aided me in expanding my knowledge purview

- Expanding Expertise in a New Technology Sector: Working on this project introduced me to the IMC space, which was a new and unfamiliar field. Conducting in-depth research on emerging technologies like IMC and related alternatives broadened my technical understanding and exposed me to cutting-edge innovations in real-time data processing

- Client-Focused Research and Presentation: Presenting research findings directly to the client each week improved my communication skills, particularly in distilling complex technical concepts into actionable insights. This helped me gain confidence in sharing strategic recommendations with senior stakeholders

- Developing Interviewing Skills with Industry Experts: Conducting interviews with key opinion leaders in the technology space helped refine my interviewing techniques, as I had to ask highly technical questions to professionals with deep expertise

- Analyzing Market and Competitive Landscape: I honed my skills in competitive analysis by identifying key players and emerging trends within the IMC ecosystem. This was crucial in helping the client understand the market dynamics and where their potential advantages lay
