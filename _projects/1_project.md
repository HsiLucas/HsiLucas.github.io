## Dissertation Overview

The rapid advancement of AI in journalism, particularly with the rise of LLMs, has sparked a debate about its impact on the profession and the trust of news consumers. This study explores consumer perceptions and trust in AI-assisted journalism, focusing on the use of AI tools for tasks such as article writing, image generation, and credibility assessment. The research employed a mixed-methods approach, combining focus groups, provotype testing, and interviews to gather data from 30 participants in the United Kingdom.

The findings reveal a cautious optimism towards AI's potential benefits, such as increased efficiency and the ability to identify newsworthy content. However, concerns persist regarding the potential homogenization of content, the perpetuation of bias, and the risk of misinformation. The study also highlights the importance of transparency and accountability in AI-assisted journalism, emphasizing the need for clear explanations of how AI tools operate and the safeguards in place to ensure accuracy and fairness. Additionally, the study suggests and guides future researchers and news organizations to be open on what their AI tools are capable of doing and what they do to restrict their tools to retain the human voice in journalism.

## Research Problem and Objectives

The study aims to explore the following key research questions:

1. How do consumers perceive the use of AI tools in journalism, especially regarding trust and credibility?
2. What are the specific concerns consumers have regarding AI-generated news content, including articles and images?
3. How do consumers believe AI should be used in journalism to support rather than replace human journalists?
4. What type of AI tool would need to be used by journalists and news organizations for consumers to trust it?

## Responsibilities

I was the sole UX designer and researcher working on this dissertation right from scratch by strategizing, conceptualizing, designing, delivering, and presenting to the dissertation supervisors and graders.

My primary responsibilities included conducting user research through focus groups and interviews to gather insights on AI in journalism, leading the development of a provotype to simulate an AI-assisted journalism tool, and analyzing user feedback using thematic analysis to inform design decisions. I was also responsible for presenting key findings and recommendations in both written and visual formats to my supervisors, supporting my dissertation defense with detailed insights and analysis.

## Methodology

This project explores how consumers in the United Kingdom perceive and trust generative AI usage in their news organizations. The selection of the United Kingdom as the focus of the study is a product of the author and university’s location in the United Kingdom. Participants were chosen through a network of colleagues and a mix of professional contacts. There were a total of 30 participants with the majority of participants being students in the University of Nottingham. Data collection ran from July to August 2024. Focus groups and interviews ranged from 30 to 60 minutes in length.

The methodology for this project integrates a combination of qualitative research techniques, each chosen for its ability to explore different dimensions of participants' perceptions and trust in AI-assisted journalism. Specifically, the project began with focus groups, followed by a demonstration of a provotype, and then a semi-structured interview. Finally, transcripts were made of the focus groups as well as the interviews and were analysed using grounded theory analysis as well as thematic analysis.

##### **Focus Groups**

The project began with recruiting two groups of five members each to conduct focus group sessions. Focus groups facilitate interactive discussions that uncover diverse perspectives which made it well suited in uncovering perceptions regarding AI in journalism. These sessions were moderated and focused on their general views on AI in journalism. In addition, a selection of questions were created with a selection of questions to facilitate discussion between the focus group members. They were also asked to provide their thoughts on a tool they would trust journalists to use to write articles.

##### **Provotyping**

Using the results from the focus groups, a provotype was developed, simulating a tool that journalists might use to create AI-assisted news articles, using Figma. A ‘provotype’ is a provocative prototype meant to provoke participants to imagine a potential future or product. Unlike a traditional prototype, which typically aims to refine a product’s usability or function, a provotype is designed to stimulate discussion and challenge participants to think critically about the implications of a technology or tool.

The provotype was made using ‘Wizard of Oz’ (WoZ) prototyping techniques and simulates the inputs and outputs a journalist may have when using the tool itself. As such, it is a speculative design showcasing a tool that has news updates for selected topics, the ‘notability’ of each piece of media, a text assistant, an image generator, and the ‘credibility’ of each piece of media. Since this tool was created in Figma, an interaction flow was created from each tab to another to facilitate a smooth and seamless user experience. This interaction flow allows participants to navigate the tool as if it were fully functional, helping them understand how a journalist might use it in practice. By simulating realistic inputs and outputs, the provotype provides a tangible representation of how AI could assist in the news creation process, enabling participants to engage more deeply with the concept and offer informed feedback on its potential utility and impact.

##### **Interviews**

After the provotyping sessions, semi-structured interviews were conducted with both participants from the focus groups and new participants. Semi-structured interviews were selected over other qualitative methods because they enable researchers to gather rich data and gain insights into the underlying reasons behind individuals' decisions by This method was used to receive both the insights from those who have gone through the focus groups and new insights from those who have only seen the provotype. This method enabled exploration into their individual experiences and perceptions. Interviews are well suited for this project as they allow for in-depth exploration of personal insights and nuanced understanding of trust and perceptions that may not surface in group discussions.

##### **Thematic Analysis**

The data from these focus groups, provotyping sessions, and interviews were then analysed using thematic analysis, a method that identifies patterns and themes within the data, allowing for a detailed examination of participants' attitudes and trust. In this case, thematic analysis was first used to develop the focus groups by identifying key concerns, attitudes, and expectations that participants had regarding AI-assisted journalism. During the analysis phase, thematic analysis allowed for a systematic categorization of the data, highlighting common patterns such as concerns over bias, the importance of maintaining journalistic integrity, and the potential benefits of AI tools. Data that was processed through this method could then be displayed and classified according to its similarities and differences.

##### **Grounded Theory**

Grounded theory was employed to develop a theoretical framework that explains how consumers perceive and trust AI-assisted journalism. Given the exploratory nature of this study, grounded theory provided a flexible yet rigorous framework for analyzing the data from focus groups, provotyping sessions, and interviews. The use of grounded theory began with the initial data collection phase, where participants' responses were carefully documented and analysed using thematic analysis. This process allowed the identification of key themes, such as concerns over bias, the importance of maintaining a human touch in journalism, and the potential benefits and pitfalls of AI tools.

Once these themes were established through thematic analysis, grounded theory was applied to develop a theoretical framework that could explain the underlying reasons for these perceptions. The iterative process of data collection and analysis characteristic of grounded theory enabled the refinement of this framework, ensuring that it accurately reflected the participants' experiences and attitudes.

The application of grounded theory was particularly instrumental in the creation of the provotype. The provotype was designed based on the theoretical insights generated from the focus group discussions, which were analysed and interpreted through the lens of grounded theory. These features were intended to address the specific issues identified during the thematic analysis, thereby making the provotype a more effective tool for eliciting further responses and validating the theoretical framework developed.

## Focus Group Results

The focus groups revealed a range of consumer perceptions regarding AI-assisted journalism, with participants expressing skepticism about AI’s capability to produce unique articles. Many voiced concerns that AI-generated content could result in homogenized journalism, lacking the distinctive human voice and depth typically associated with traditional newswriting. This fear of standardization was paired with ethical concerns, particularly in sensitive contexts like historical events or political news, where participants feared AI-generated images and content could trivialize serious issues or mislead readers. The overarching sentiment was a strong preference for authentic, human-written journalism that reflects diverse perspectives and personal narratives.

In addition to concerns about content homogenization, participants expressed significant unease about AI's potential to propagate misinformation, biases, and echo chambers. A key worry was that AI models, especially those trained on biased or Western-centric datasets, could perpetuate negative stereotypes and limit the diversity of global perspectives in journalism. Participants emphasized the need for AI tools to be transparent, credible, and reliable, with a clear framework for vetting sources and ensuring journalistic integrity. They also highlighted areas where AI could play a supportive role, such as identifying newsworthy content, verifying credibility, and assisting with post-writing analysis, provided it didn’t overshadow the creative input of human journalists.

## Provotype Design

The thematic analysis of focus group discussions was instrumental in shaping the provotype's design. Key themes, such as the fear of content homogenization, concerns over bias, and the need to preserve journalistic integrity, directly influenced the design decisions. Participants’ feedback led to the development of features that sought to balance AI’s potential benefits while addressing the apprehensions surrounding its impact on news credibility and the preservation of human creativity.

##### **Notability**

The original idea of ‘newsworthiness’ was expanded into a more detailed ‘notability’ system based on participant feedback. Participants were wary of potential bias in how AI might determine what is ‘newsworthy.’ As a result, the provotype incorporated a ranking system that used data-driven metrics, such as keyword trends, search results over time, and related topics, to assign a notability score to each story. This system provided greater transparency and reduced bias by presenting sentiment scores alongside keyword detections, addressing participant concerns while ensuring a broader range of perspectives in content selection.

##### **Credibility**

Participants expressed concerns about AI’s potential to spread misinformation and highlighted the need for a tool to assess the credibility of sources without undermining journalistic integrity. In response, the provotype incorporated a credibility feature that evaluates the trustworthiness of related links and sources. It breaks down where information originates and includes a ‘Text Relativity’ feature, which rates the relevance of related articles to the main source. This feature aimed to ensure that content is verified through credible channels and helps combat misinformation by offering transparency in the source evaluation process.

##### **Text Analysis**

Given the strong opposition to AI-generated articles, the focus shifted towards developing a text analysis feature. Participants valued tools that assist journalists rather than replace their creative process, so the text generation feature was removed from the provotype. Instead, the text analysis feature was introduced to provide suggestions on missing key points based on the selected sources. This allowed journalists to refine their content without compromising their unique voice and creativity, aligning with participants' desire for AI to act as an aid rather than a replacement in the journalistic process.

##### **Image Generation**

The inclusion of an AI image generation feature sparked mixed reactions from participants. While some felt it was a valuable tool for smaller outlets with limited resources, others were concerned it could diminish the credibility of established institutions like the BBC. Despite these concerns, the image generation feature was included in the provotype to provoke further reflection on AI’s role in visual journalism. Its inclusion aimed to stimulate discussions around the ethical implications of AI-generated images, especially in terms of news accuracy and the potential for misleading or inappropriate visuals.

## Analysis

The findings from the focus groups and interviews revealed complex perceptions of AI-assisted journalism, with a mix of optimism and skepticism prevailing among participants. One of the most prominent concerns was the potential loss of the human element in journalism, particularly the fear that AI-generated articles would lack the personal touch, voice, and creativity that human journalists bring to their work. Participants highlighted the risk of homogenization in content, where AI could standardize writing styles and strip away the unique perspectives that distinguish quality journalism. This skepticism was grounded in the belief that AI, despite its efficiency, lacks the ability to fully understand and convey the emotional depth and context of human-authored stories. This concern about losing the human voice was a consistent theme across discussions and directly influenced the design decisions for the provotype.

However, participants also acknowledged the potential benefits of AI, particularly in areas such as data processing, identifying trends, and fact-checking. AI’s ability to sift through large volumes of information to identify newsworthy content and assess the credibility of sources was seen as a positive contribution to the journalistic process. These tools were viewed as complementary to human effort, enhancing efficiency without undermining the journalist’s role in crafting narratives. The feedback emphasized the need for AI to remain in an assistive role, providing suggestions and supporting journalists in their research, writing, and editing, rather than fully generating content.

The concerns about bias and misinformation were another major theme that emerged from the analysis. Participants worried about the potential for AI models trained on biased datasets to reinforce existing echo chambers and perpetuate inaccuracies, particularly when dealing with sensitive topics such as politics or global news. The provotype’s credibility feature, which aimed to provide transparency about the trustworthiness of sources, was designed to address these concerns by offering journalists a clearer understanding of where information originates and how it relates to the main content. This feature, along with the notability ranking system, demonstrated how AI could be used responsibly to enhance the integrity of journalism while mitigating the risks of misinformation and biased reporting.

## Implications

The implications of these findings are significant for the future of journalism. As AI tools become more integrated into newsrooms, it will be crucial for news organizations to address the concerns raised by consumers regarding trust, authenticity, and bias. This may involve developing clear guidelines for the ethical use of AI in journalism, ensuring transparency about when and how AI tools are used, and maintaining a strong focus on preserving the unique voices and perspectives that define quality journalism.

Additionally, these findings suggest that open communication with the public about what the AI tools in journalism are able to do will positively affect trust in AI-assisted articles. By helping consumers understand the benefits and limitations of AI tools, news organizations can build trust and ensure that AI is seen as a valuable aid rather than a threat to the integrity of journalism. This study also hopes to influence organizations to demo the AI tools they use to the public to elicit trust.
