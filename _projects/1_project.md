<h2>Project Overview</h2>

A Fortune 500 med tech company is evaluating new eye care segments as potential areas for new growth. They’re a global leader in vision and are looking to leverage their vision expertise to build capabilities within the glaucoma market as a potential area of growth. They lack any high-potential glaucoma assets in the pipeline, but the market is an interesting adjacency given its high growth, high unmet need, and alignment with the company’s capabilities and growth leads. In particular, they are interested in the opportunity to potentially leverage their polymer capabilities within the glaucoma space, but also understand the opportunity in the glaucoma surgical space.

This project overview details the research process to evaluate the glaucoma opportunity and prioritize potential technology platforms:

    Global Glaucoma Surgical Landscape Assessment

Assess the glaucoma therapy landscape, evaluate drivers and barriers to growth in the glaucoma surgical vision market

    Global Glaucoma Prioritization Strategy Assessment

Assess the glaucoma therapy landscape in the vision care glaucoma market(s)
Understand the clinical and customer unmet need within glaucoma, with a specific focus on extended-release therapies and drug/delivery landscape
Evaluate value proposition of potential solutions and prioritize emerging disease intervention opportunities in the glaucoma space, understand synergies with existing capabilities
Develop a recommended glaucoma portfolio development strategy focused on inorganic growth opportunities

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images, even citations {% cite einstein1950meaning %}.
Say you wanted to write a bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image"
        class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image"
        class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
```

{% endraw %}
