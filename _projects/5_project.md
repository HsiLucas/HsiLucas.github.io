## Project Overview

A Fortune 500 medical device company is is building and commercializing a suite of digital surgery software solutions. Among these solutions is a software solution that creates a digitized roadmap for surgery, translating 2D scans into 3D models for pre-operative planning. This solution, combined with the company's suite of digital software solutions is intended to operate as a standalone offering, but also to seed the market in anticipation of other digital surgery platform(s). Upon launch, the software will compete in Asia-Pac with a number of regional players in the pre-operative planning space, with 2 primary competitors leading the Japanese market.

This 2-month project overview details the research process to assess the competitive landscape and commercial opportunity for the software in the Japanese market:

##### Project Objectives

-   Assess the competitive landscape for 3D surgical modeling and pre-operative planning software
-   Evaluate competitive value drivers for the software
-   Validate and refine the client's current understanding of competitive contracting and pricing strategy
-   Develop contracting, positioning, and business model strategy for the client's software

## Responsibilities

I was 1 of 2 researchers working on the Japanese market landscape, including analysis and interviews with stakeholders in Japanese. Additionally, I took part in the competitive analysis of competitors, creating an overview of the market landscape, and the provision of market sizing and forecasting tools. During the weekly updates and the final presentation, I was also responsible for presenting my section of the research directly to the client.

My primary responsibilies included the creation of the Japanese interview script with my fellow researcher, reaching out to relevant external stakeholders, conducting interviews in both English and Japanese, analysis of quotes and secondary research, and the creation of presentation slides for my research.

## User Research

As shown in the engagement timeline, the first step in the project was the creation of 9 project scope questions that covered questions the company sought to answer in their competitive landscape and commercial opportunity analysis. Afterwards, an interview guide was created in order to conduct 25 semi-structured interviews with key opinion leaders (KOLs).

The information gathered from the interviews were built upon one another to create a more well-informed interview guide as the project went on. Additionally, the insights on preferred brands and pricing packages helped create the estimated market share for 3D modeling medical devices in Japan. Participants ranged from Analysts, Allied Medical Staff, Surgeons, and Administrative sources.

## Analysis

Research began with a dive into secondary sources, including market sizing reports, use statistics, competitor reports, and government requirements for health, labor, and welfare. These sources helped me develop the initial market sizing estimates, competitive landscape, and gaps in the market where the client's software may target. From there, the interview guide was tailored to and competitive to the Japanese healthcare ecosystem to ensure the insights gathered were relevant to the market. Additionally, the client provided a demonstration video that was dubbed over by me and my fellow researcher.

The interview process was structured to reveal unmet needs within the Japanese 3D surgical space as well as the client's pricing model. To assess gaps in the market, I designed questions to probe their thoughts and issues with existing technologies, their openness to a foreign company's 3D surgical devices, and the contracting models most common in Japan. Additionally, I analyzed competitor activity through secondary research on major players in the market. I researched what innovations were being introduced by local Japanese companies as well as multinational corporations. This helped to frame the competitive landscape and pinpoint where opportunities for innovation existed.

## Reflections and Takeaways

I got a chance to sharpen both my research and client presentation skills as well as perform work in a foreign language. This was also one of my first projects and interviewing in Japanese helped me in my confidence in my future projects.

-   **Improving Multilingual Communication Skills**: Conducting interviews in both English and Japanese helped sharpen my ability to communicate complex technical concepts across languages

-   **Navigating a Competitive Landscape**: Analyzing competitors in a highly specialized market like 3D surgical modeling gave me valuable insights into how to identify and assess the strengths and weaknesses of local and multinational companies. This helped me develop a keen sense of market opportunities and competitive dynamics

-   **Market Sizing and Forecasting Expertise**: This project allowed me to dive deep into market sizing and forecasting, enhancing my skills in estimating market shares and commercial opportunities, which are critical in strategic decision-making.
