## Project Overview

A Fortune 500 pharmaceutical company is broadening their portfolio into immunology, rare diseases and specialty pharma with a focus on central nervous system (CNS) assets. With this expansion, the Payor Sales division of the company will encounter new customer segments, different needs from reimbursement channels, evolving distribution channels, and other areas that are new to the company. In addition to portfolio expansion, market dynamics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and emerging commercial/sales team models, will likely impact their Payor Sales in ways it would like to better understand.

This 3-month project overview details the research process to assess the new and evolving dynamics of selling to payor customers and implications to their Payor Sales strategy:

##### Project Objectives

-   Identify current capabilities of Payor Sales team
-   Assess the evolving needs and expectations of payor customers
    -   Including impact of COVID-19 and other identified macro trends for the industry
-   Understand payorsâ€™ needs and expectations for new therapeutic areas
    -   Including immunology, rare diseases, and specialty pharma (e.g., CNS)
    -   Including new reimbursement and distribution channels
    -   Including new stakeholders/influencers
-   Benchmark the best practices, activities, and structure and responsibilities of sales organizations at comparable industry competitors
-   Recommend strategies to evolve the company's payor sales and engagement approach

## Responsibilities

I was 1 of 3 researchers working on the project, including analysis and interviews with key opinion leaders (KOLs). Additionally, I conducted research in the competitive landscape of branded and generic incumbent therapies across the relevant CNS and immunotherapy areas. This also included how comparable pharmaceutical companies are partnered with and selling to payors. During the weekly updates and the final presentation, I was also responsible for presenting my section of the research directly to the client.

My primary responsibilies included reaching out to relevant external stakeholders, conducting interviews, analysis of quotes and secondary research, and the creation of presentation slides for my research.

## User Research

As shown in the engagement timeline, the first step in the project was the creation of 8 project scope questions that covered questions the client sought to answer in their new customer segments for the Payor Sales division. Afterwards, an interview guide was created to conduct the semi-structured interviews with internal employees. These interviews were conducted to determine the thoughts, feelings, and ideas of the workers currently in the Payor Sales division.

The information gathered from this data helped inform the subsequent interview guide for external KOLs as well as shape how the project was tackled. This guide was then used to interview a total of 15 outside sources. Participants ranged from National Payors, Regional Payors, Federal Payors, Pharmaceutical Manufacturers, and Analysts.

## Analysis

Research began with a deep dive into available secondary sources, including publically available pipelines of competitors, program guides, expected job responsibilities of competitors in similar roles, and market insights. An interview guide was made within the research team as well as insights from the client on specific questions they wanted to ask. These sources helped gauge what steps the client would need to take to facilitate the growth and introduction of these added customer segments.

Following the completion of research, an additional 3 weeks were also scheduled for stategy development. This time was held for larger discussions with the company as well as the consolidation of final recommendations. Best practices and competitive landscaping for pharmaceutical manufacturers in terms of internal structure, strategy, and payor engagement were consolidated from research and finalized at this time.

## Reflections and Takeaways

Research into the payor space was both a new and exciting avenue of research for me. It was an unfamiliar field that not many researchers have the opportunity to look into. The experience also allowed me to improve my client presentation skills and expand my knowledge base.

-   **Exploring a New Field**: Researching the payor sales space, especially in the context of new therapeutic areas like immunology and CNS, was an exciting challenge. It expanded my knowledge into an unfamiliar field, allowing me to gain unique insights into how pharmaceutical companies interact with payors

-   **Client-Focused Insights**: Presenting my findings directly to the client helped refine my communication and client-facing skills. I learned how to translate complex research into strategic recommendations that aligned with the client's evolving needs

-   **Understanding Market Dynamics**: This project gave me the opportunity to delve into macro trends affecting the pharmaceutical industry, such as the impact of COVID-19, and how they influence payor expectations
