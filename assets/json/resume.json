The research employed a mixed-methods approach, combining focus groups, provotype testing, and interviews to gather data from 30 participants in the United Kingdom. The findings reveal a cautious optimism towards AI's potential benefits, such as increased efficiency and the ability to identify newsworthy content. However, concerns persist regarding the potential homogenization of content, the perpetuation of bias, and the risk of misinformation."
