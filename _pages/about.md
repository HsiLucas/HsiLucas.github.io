I am a mixed-methods researcher with projects ranging from AI-Consumer Trust to 3D Surgical Medical Device Opportunity Assessment. I graduated with a MSc in Human Computer Interaction at the University in 2024 and a BA in Psychology at New York University in 2021. I have worked as a Consultant for the Beacon Group as well as a Research Analyst for Accenture for 2 years. Additionally, I have experience in user research, growth strategy, market sizing, client-facing communication, and competitive strategy and analysis. This website displays case studies of some of my previous work as well as well as an overview of my dissertation.

MSc Dissertation: "Consumer Perceptions, Trust, and Implications on User Assisted AI Journalism"

A bit about my hobbies: I've been an avid skier for over 21 years and I've fenced competitively in both the United States as well as the United Kingdom. I enjoy traveling, eating good food, and PC building in my spare time.
