MSc'24 in Human Computer Interaction at the University of Nottingham. Previously a consultant for the Beacon Group and a Research Analyst for Accenture Strategy with 2 years of professional experience. Expertise in AI-Consumer trust, user experience, growth strategy, market sizing, client-facing communication, and competitive strategy and analysis.

I am a mixed-methods researcher with projects ranging from AI-Consumer Trust to 3D Surgical Medical Device Opportunity Assessment. This website displays case studies of some of my previous work as well as well as an overview of my dissertation.

MSc Dissertation: "Consumer Perceptions, Trust, and Implications on User Assisted AI Journalism"

A bit about my hobbies: I've been an avid skier for over 21 years and I've fenced competitively in both the United States as well as the United Kingdom. I enjoy traveling, eating good food, and PC building in my spare time.
